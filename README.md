The main focus of this report is to apply and use all the concepts learnt from Applied Bayesian Statistics on finding the posterior distribution and Bayesian estimates. This is done using JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), a software that builds MCMC samplers for complex hierarchical models. Robust Logistic Regression is used here to classify the data into different categories on gas used. JAGS model diagram shows the Robust Logistic Regression setting in this problem. Since there is no prior expert knowledge in regard to the chosen dataset, Prior distributions are specified reflecting the non-informative analysis. The analysis is carried out by formulating the likelihood and prior distributions to assess the appropriateness of the MCMC chains for each parameter using the MCMC diagnostics and inferences are drawn based on the Bayesian point and interval estimates. Overall, based on the diagnostic checks, the resultant Bayesian estimates of the parameters of the logistic model are significant in classifying with a 95% HDI. The obtained model is then tested on a data. Performance metrics are calculated. Bayesian model comparison methodology is used to compare the models and select the model with greater accuracy.
